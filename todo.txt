done:
    set up express
    render project start
    install react and get a landing page
    modularize componants
    pass variables through parent/child/ sibling 
    onclick and onHover events
    import and use semantic
    incorporate routing
    put some cards on screen
    pull in all of your dominion code
    finish new game button
    dynamic screen reresh by adjusting state <-- dont try to work around state and props just use em
    all cards including played and draw hand

rightnow:
    fix played cards
    fix updating first players draw hand display something is breaking in the timeing
    add stats for player and game
    initialize game loop
    add onclick actions
    
    
    manage data with props and state and context

near term:
    add card on play methods
    manage player log in 

midterm:
    hot seat play
    to get persitant state looks like I'm going to need a store like flux or redux
    look at creating a object called data store and useing that instance inleu of redux
    or use local storage



long term :
    save player stats to db
    save game state (maybe to database?)
    will want sockets.io
    get npm start to run a better .bat file with mongo and rebuild
    ensure that babel is working???
    incorporate offside-jsy
    figure out .js vs .jsx
    learn lodash
    use object.assign({}, foo) to get around passing objects by refrerence


For fun:
    add mouse hover or right click inspect of cards
    grab some card art http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Isotropic_art_gallery
