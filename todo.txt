Cool tech:

    take a look at class names https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames
   
    symlinks - https://gist.github.com/branneman/8048520, https://github.com/DSKrepps/requireFrom, or maybe make a lib file similar to how you 
        handles cards and just dumb everything into there

done:
    set up express
    manage data with props and state and context
    render project start
    install react and get a landing page
    modularize componants
    pass variables through parent/child/ sibling 
    onclick and onHover events
    import and use semantic
    incorporate routing
    put some cards on screen
    pull in all of your dominion code
    finish new game button
    dynamic screen reresh by adjusting state <-- dont try to work around state and props just use em
    all cards including played and draw hand
    add in redux store to make keeping track of cards easier -switching to mobx
    take a look at flux and dispatchers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZfCVq5iCBw&list=PLoYCgNOIyGABj2GQSlDRjgvXtqfDxKm5b&index=9#t=35.959125
    take a look at redux https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w-oQ-i1XB8&index=15&list=PLoYCgNOIyGABj2GQSlDRjgvXtqfDxKm5b
    install and edit rewire to allow for mobx decorators (yes this would have been WAAAAY easier to jus tmanually adjust the config in node modules)
    fix vs code error with ts config (which is funny that its js but whatever)
    get a mobx store working
    finish mobx tutorial for full front end cruds
    save game state in mobx
    use appstore to allow hand cards to go to played cards
    do same with on click
    fix played cards
    fix updating first players draw hand display something is breaking in the timeing
    add onclick actions
    there is a bug in moving cards to played... none of the stats are comeing over and it's deleting the score - fixed the tally score method and removed the concats that seemed to fix it --- it looks like it has somethign to do with mobx mutating the card object into observable arrays   
    add stats for player and game
    initialize game loop --- becasue this is turn based there doenst actually needto be a game loop, one funcion will call the next until the game end condition is met
    Fix player feed back messages
    hot seat play
    to get persitant state looks like I'm going to need a store like flux or redux
    look at creating a object called data store and useing that instance inleu of redux
    or use local storage
    move all phase change logic over to the gameobject
    move files over to classes folder
    only allow cards to be played from hand not from anywhere
    fixed - can play cards out of any area not just hand
        debug end game logic not ending on time
    debug button text not updating properly
    double check reseting phase and messages and button text
    add onClick handler object
    incapsulate methods into the card logic passed through handler
    Cellar	Action	$2	+1 Action
        Discard any number of cards.
        +1 Card per card discarded.
    Chapel	Action	$2	Trash up to 4 cards from your hand.
    Moat	Action – Reaction	$2	+2 Cards
    Chancellor	Action	$3	+$2 You may immediately put your deck into your discard pile.
    Village	Action	$3	+1 Card; +2 Actions.
    Woodcutter	Action	$3	+1 Buy; +$2.
    Workshop	Action	$3	Gain a card costing up to $4.
    Feast	Action	$4	Trash this card. Gain a card costing up to $5.

    Market	Action	$5	+1 Card; +1 Action; +1 Buy; +$1.
    Bureaucrat	Action – Attack	$4	Gain a silver card; put it on top of your deck. Each other player reveals a Victory card from his hand and puts it on his deck (or reveals a hand with no Victory cards).

        put it into your hand
    Gardens	Victory	$4	Worth 1 Victory for every 10 cards in your deck (rounded down). - its in but buggy
    Library	Action	$5	Draw until you have 7 cards in hand. You may set aside any Action cards drawn this way,
    as you draw them; discard the set aside cards after you finish drawing.  
        Adventurer	Action	$6	Reveal cards from your deck until you reveal 2 Treasure cards. Put those Treasure
       cards in your hand and discard the other revealed cards.
    i think the withc is curing the person that plays them
    hmmm I just realized that cards like the witch might be tricky
    make button text dynamic based on phase in the same way that message text is
    figure out how to make your decks extend arrays so you can stop calling deck.cards
    refactor all cards to use a stack resolve system
        Throne Room	Action	$4	Choose an Action card in your hand. Play it twice.
    message isnt getting reset at start of action phase
    it also feels like the shuffle may not be working
    Victory points are broken
    Militia	Action – Attack	$4	+$2

rightnow:

    implement sockets for a chat screen in the tutorial side
    have a login and register for new players
    implement multiplayer
     have a start game screen to asign players and ai
    will want sockets.io

    Spy	Action – Attack	$4	+1 Card; +1 Action

 

    show empty pile on screen

    
    
    
    

near term:
    have all player feed back through modals
    the draw,discard,gain,move methods in both player and deck classes need to be consolodated and generalized
    add some more cards - pick 10 more fun one
    allow cards to remain in play area and not be discarded if they are persistant
    learn how yeild and generators work
    make a save game button to push to local storage
    have new game clear saved game in local storage
    
    manage player log in 
    figure out the difference between js and jsx

    clean out old comments and recomment for others to read 


bugs:
    
    canceling out of the new game popup breaks things
    no validations on new game popup


midterm:
    validate that game is over and force restart
    add art to cards
    reformat screen layout and add some styleing
    animate card moving from hand to play and draw to play
    have a game log display as part of gamestats



long term :
    import routes to avoid from "../../../garbage" ... my first attempt didnt work come back to this later
    symlinks needs to be next i think
    save player stats to db
    save game state (maybe to database?)
    
    get npm start to run a better .bat file with mongo and rebuild
    ensure that babel is working
    incorporate offside-jsy
    figure out .js vs .jsx
    learn lodash
    use object.assign({}, foo) to get around passing objects by refrerence
   
    have some ai (just start with random)

For fun:
    add mouse hover or right click inspect of cards
    grab some card art http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Isotropic_art_gallery


Notes:
    right now to use @ decorators (which is most mobx tutts) you need to add the transform-decorators-legacy
    yourself in node_modules/react-scripts/config/babel.dev.js, as I don't want to go tinkering around with
    the out of the box code just yet just use the observer functions instead of the decorators --- I fixed this problem with npm react-rewire
